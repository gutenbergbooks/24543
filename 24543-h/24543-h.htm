<h1>THE<br />
<big><span class="hd1">CIRCUIT</span><br />
RIDERS</big></h1>

<p>On the Board,<br />
they were just little<br />
lights that glowed.<br />
But out there<br />
in the night of the<br />
city-jungle,<br />
they represented<br />
human passions&mdash;<br />
virulent emotions&mdash;<br />
and deadly crimes-to-be ...</p>

<h2>by R. C. FitzPatrick</h2>

<p><b><small>Illustrated by Schoenherr</small></b></p></div>

<hr />

<p>&#9632; He was an old man and very
drunk. Very drunk or very sick. It
was the middle of the day and the
day was hot, but the old man had
on a suit, and a sweater under the
suit. He stopped walking and stood
still, swaying gently on widespread
legs, and tried to focus his eyes. He
lived here ... around here ...
somewhere around here. He continued
on, stumbling up the street.</p>

<p>He finally made it home. He lived
on the second floor and he dragged
himself up the narrow staircase with
both hands clutching the railing.
But he was still very careful of the
paper bag under his arm. The bag
was full of beer.</p>

<p>Once in the room, he managed to
take off his coat before he sank
down on the bed. He just sat there,
vacant and lost and empty, and
drank his beer.</p>

<hr />

<p>It was a hot, muggy, August afternoon&mdash;Wednesday
in Pittsburgh.
The broad rivers put moisture in the
air, and the high hills kept it there.
Light breezes were broken-up and
diverted by the hills before they
could bring more than a breath of
relief.</p>

<p>In the East Liberty precinct station
the doors and windows were
opened wide to snare the vagrant
breezes. There were eight men in
the room; the desk sergeant, two
beat cops waiting to go on duty, the
audio controller, the deAngelis operator,
two reporters, and a local book
... businessman. From the back
of the building, the jail proper, the
voice of a prisoner asking for a
match floated out to the men in the
room, and a few minutes later they
heard the slow, exasperated steps of
the turnkey as he walked over to
give his prisoner a light.</p>

<p>At 3:32 pm, the deAngelis board
came alive as half-a-dozen lights
flashed red, and the needles on the
dials below them trembled in the
seventies and eighties. Every other
light on the board showed varying
shades of pink, registering in the
sixties. The operator glanced at the
board, started to note the times and
intensities of two of the dials in his
log, scratched them out, then went
on with his conversation with the
audio controller. The younger reporter
got up and came over to the
board. The controller and the operator
looked up at him.</p>

<p>"Nothing," said the operator shaking
his head in a negative. "Bad call
at the ball game, probably." He
nodded his head towards the lights
on the deAngelis, "They'll be gone
in five, ten minutes."</p>

<p>The controller reached over and
turned up the volume on his radio.
The radio should not have been
there, but as long as everyone did
his job and kept the volume low, the
Captain looked the other way. The
set belonged to the precinct.</p>

<p>The announcer's voice came on,
"... ning up, he's fuming. Doak is
holding Sterrett back. What a beef!
Brutaugh's got his nose not two
inches from Frascoli's face, and
Brother! is he letting him have it.
Oh! Oh! Here comes Gilbert off the
mound; he's stalking over. When Gil
puts up a holler, you know he thinks
it's a good one. Brutaugh keeps
pointing at the foul line&mdash;you can
see from here the chalk's been wiped
away&mdash;he's insisting the runner slid
out of the base path. Frascoli's
walking away, but Danny's going
right aft ..." The controller turned
the volume down again.</p>

<p>The lights on the deAngelis board
kept flickering, but by 3:37 all but
two had gone out, one by one.
These two showed readings in the
high sixties; one flared briefly to
78.2 then went out. Brutaugh was
no longer in the ball game. By 3:41
only one light still glowed, and it
was steadily fading.</p>

<p>Throughout the long, hot, humid
afternoon the board held its reddish,
irritated overtones, and occasional
readings flashed in and out of
the seventies. At four o'clock the
new duty section came on; the deAngelis
operator, whose name was
Chuck Matesic, was replaced by an
operator named Charlie Blaney.</p>

<p>"Nothing to report," Chuck told
Charlie. "Rhubarb down at the
point at the Forbes Municipal Field,
but that's about all."</p>

<p>The new operator scarcely glanced
at the mottled board, it was that
kind of a day. He noted an occasional
high in his log book, but most
signals were ignored. At 5:14 he
noted a severe reading of 87 which
stayed on the board; at 5:16 another
light came on, climbed slowly
through the sixties, then soared to 77
where it held steady. Neither light
was an honest red, their angry overtones
chased each other rapidly.</p>

<p>The deAngelis operator called
over to the audio controller, "Got us
a case of crinkle fender, I think."</p>

<p>"Where?" the controller asked.</p>

<p>"Can't tell yet," Blaney said. "A
hot-head and a citizen with righteous
indignation. They're clear
enough, but not too sharp." He
swiveled in his chair and adjusted
knobs before a large circular screen.
Pale streaks of light glowed briefly
as the sweep passed over them.
There were milky dots everywhere.
A soft light in the lower left hand
corner of the screen cut an uncertain
path across the grid, and two
indeterminate splotches in the upper
half of the scope flared out to the
margin.</p>

<p>"Morningside," the operator said.</p>

<p>The splashes of light separated;
one moved quickly off the screen,
the other held stationary for several
minutes, then contracted and began
a steady, jagged advance toward the
center of the grid. One inch down,
half an inch over, two inches down,
then four inches on a diagonal line.</p>

<p>"Like I said," said Blaney. "An accident."</p>

<p>Eight minutes later, at 5:32, a
slightly pompous and thoroughly
outraged young salesman marched
through the doors of the station
house and over to the desk sergeant.</p>

<p>"Some clown just hit me ..." he
began.</p>

<p>"With his fist?" asked the sergeant.</p>

<p>"With his car," said the salesman.
"My car ... with his car ... he
hit my car with his car."</p>

<p>The sergeant raised his hand.
"Simmer down, young feller. Let
me see your driver's license." He
reached over the desk for the man's
cards with one hand, and with the
other he sorted out an accident form.
"Just give it to me slowly." He started
filling out the form.</p>

<p>The deAngelis operator leaned
back in his chair and winked at the
controller. "I'm a whiz," he said to
the young reporter, "I'm a pheenom.
I never miss." The reporter smiled
and walked back to his colleague
who was playing gin with the book
... businessman.</p>

<p>The lights glowed on and off all
evening, but only once had they
called for action. At 10:34 two sharp
readings of 92.2 and 94 even, had
sent Blaney back to his dials and
screen. He'd narrowed it down to a
four-block area when the telephone
rang to report a fight at the Red
Antler Grill. The controller dispatched
a beat cop already in the
area.</p>

<p>Twenty minutes later, two very
large&mdash;and very obedient young
toughs stumbled in, followed by an
angry officer. In addition to the
marks of the fight, both had a lumbering,
off-balance walk that showed
that the policeman had been prodding
them with his riot club. It was
called an "electronic persuader"; it
also doubled as a carbine. Police no
longer carried sidearms.</p>

<p>He pointed to the one on the left,
"This one hit me." He pointed to the
one on the right, "This one kicked
me."</p>

<p>The one on the left was certain
he would never hit another cop. The
one on the right knew he would
never kick another cop.</p>

<p>"Book 'em," the sergeant said. He
looked at the two youths. "You're
going in the can ... you want to
argue." The youths looked down.
No one else said anything. The
younger reporter came over and
took down the information as the
cop and the two toughs gave it to
the sergeant. Then he went back to
his seat at the card table and took
a minityper from his pocket. He
started sending to the paper.</p>

<p>"You ought to send that stuff direct,"
the card player said.</p>

<p>"I scribble too bad," the reporter
answered.</p>

<p>"Bat crap," said the older man,
"that little jewel can transcribe
chicken scratches."</p>

<p>The cub scrunched over his minityper.
A few minutes later he looked
up at his partner, "What's a good
word for hoodlum?"</p>

<p>The other reporter was irritated.
He was also losing at gin. "What are
you, a Steinbeck?" He laid down his
cards. "Look kid, just send it, just
the way you get it. That's why they
pay re-write men. We're reporters.
We report. O.K.?" He went back to
his cards.</p>

<p>At 11:40 a light at the end of the
second row turned pinkish but no
reading showed on the dial below.
It was only one of a dozen bulbs
showing red. It was still pinkish
when the watch was changed.
Blaney was replaced by King.</p>

<p>"Watch this one," Blaney said to
King, indicating an entry in the log.
It was numbered 8:20:18:3059:78:4a.
"I've had it on four times now,
all in the high seventies. I got a feeling."
The number indicated date,
estimated area and relation to previous
alerts in the month, estimated
intent, and frequency of report. The
"a" meant intermittent. Only the last
three digits would change. "If it
comes on again I think I'd lock a
circuit on it right away." The rules
called for any continuous reading
over 75 to be contacted and connected
after its sixth appearance.</p>

<p>"What about that one?" King
said, pointing to a 70.4 that was unblinking
in its intensity.</p>

<p>"Some drunk," said Blaney. "Or a
baby with a head cold. Been on
there for twenty minutes. You can
watch for it if you like." His tone
suggested that to be a waste of
time.</p>

<p>"I'll watch it," said King. His tone
suggested that he knew how to read
a circuit, and if Blaney had any suggestions
he could keep them to himself.</p>

<hr />

<p>Joe Millsop finally staggered home,
exhausted. He was half-drunk, and
worn out from being on his feet all
day, but the liquor had finally done
its work. He could think about the
incident without flushing hot all
over. He was too tired, and too sorry
for himself to be angry at anyone.
And with his new-found alcoholic
objectivity he could see now where
he had been in the wrong. Old
Bloomgarten shouldn't have chewed
him out in front of a customer like
that, but what the hell, he shouldn't
have sassed the customer, even if
she was just a dumb broad who
didn't know what she wanted. He
managed to get undressed before he
stumbled into bed. His last coherent
thought before he fell into a drugged
sleep was that he'd better apologize
in the morning.</p>

<hr />

<p>8:20:18:3059:78:4a stayed off
the board.</p>

<p>At 1:18 am, the deAngelis flared
to a 98.4 then started inching down
again. The young reporter sat up,
alert, from where he had been dozing.
The loud clang of a bell had
brought him awake.</p>

<p>The older reporter glanced up
from his cards and waved him down.
"Forget it," he said, "some wife just
opened the door and saw lipstick on
her husband's neck."</p>

<hr />

<p>"Oh Honey, how could you ...
fifty dollars ..." She was crying.</p>

<p>"Don't, Mother ... I thought I
could make some money ... some
real money." The youngster looked
sick. "I had four nines ... four
nines ... how could I figure him
for a straight flush, he didn't have a
thing showing."</p>

<p>"... How could you," sobbed
the mother. "... Oh how could
you."</p>

<hr />

<p>The book ... businessman dealt
the cards. The reporter picked his up
and arranged them in his hand, he
discarded one; the businessman ignored
it and drew from the deck, he
discarded; the reporter picked the
discard and threw away a card from
his hand; the businessman drew
from the deck and discarded the
same card he'd drawn; the reporter
picked it up, tapped it slowly in
place with his elbow, placed his discard
face down, and spread his
hand.</p>

<p>"Gin," he said.</p>

<p>"Arrrgh," said the businessman.
"Damn it, you play good. You play
real good."</p>

<p>A light on the deAngelis flashed
red and showed a reading of 65.4 on
the dial.</p>

<p>"Can't beat skill," said the reporter.
"Count!"</p>

<p>"Fifty-six," said the businessman.
"That's counting gin," he added.</p>

<p>"Game," the reporter announced.
"I'll figure the damage."</p>

<p>"You play good," said the businessman
in disgust.</p>

<p>"You only say that 'cause it's
true," the reporter said. "But it's
sweet of you all the same."</p>

<p>"Shut up!" said the businessman.</p>

<p>The reporter looked up, concerned.
"You stuck?" he asked solicitously.
He seemed sincere.</p>

<p>"Certainly I'm stuck," the businessman
snarled.</p>

<p>"Then stay stuck," said the reporter
in a kindly tone. He patted the
businessman on the cheek.</p>

<p>The same light on the deAngelis
flashed red. This time the dial registered
eighty-two. The operator
chuckled and looked over at the
gamblers, where the reporter was
still adding up the score.</p>

<p>"How much you down, Bernie?"
he asked the businessman.</p>

<p>"Four dollars and ninety-six cents,"
the reporter answered.</p>

<p>"You play good," Bernie said
again.</p>

<p>The deAngelis went back to normal,
and the operator went back to
his magazine. The bulb at the end of
the second row turned from a light
pink to a soft rose, the needle on its
dial finally flickered on to the scale.
There were other lights on the board,
but none called for action. It was
still just a quiet night in the middle
of the week.</p>

<hr />

<p>The room was filthy. It had a natural
filth that clings to a cheap room,
and a man-made, careless filth that
would disfigure a Taj Mahal. It wasn't
so much that things were dirty, it
was more that nothing was clean.
Pittsburgh was no longer a smokey
city. That problem had been solved
long before the mills had stopped
belching smoke. Now, with atomics
and filters on every stack in every
home, the city was clean. Clean as
the works of man could make it, yet
still filthy as only the minds of man
could achieve. The city might be
clean but there were people who
were not, and the room was not.
Overhead the ceiling light still
burned, casting its harsh glare on the
trashy room, and the trashy, huddled
figure on the bed.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p>He was an old man, lying on the
bed fully clothed,
even to his shoes. He
twisted fretfully in his sleep;
the body tried to rise, anticipating nature
even when the mind could not.
The man gagged several times and
finally made it up to a sitting position
before the vomit came. He was
still asleep, but his reaction was automatic;
he grabbed the bottom of his
sweater and pulled it out before him
to form a bucket of sorts. When he
finished being sick he sat still, swaying
gently back and forth, and tried
to open his eyes. He could not make
it. Still asleep, he ducked out of the
fouled sweater, made an
ineffectual dab at his mouth,
wadded the sweater in a ball, and threw
it over in front of the bathroom door.</p>

<p>He fell back on the bed, exhausted,
and went on with his fitful sleep.</p>

<hr />

<p>At 4:15 in the morning a man
walked into the station house. His
name was Henry Tilton. He was a reporter
for the <i>Evening Press</i>. He
waved a greeting to the desk sergeant
and went over to kibitz the
card game.</p>

<p>Both players looked up, startled.
The reporter playing cards said,
"Hello, Henry." He looked at his
watch. "Whoosh! I didn't realize it
was that late." He turned to the
businessman. "Hurry up, finish the
hand. Got to get my beauty sleep."</p>

<p>"Whaddaya mean, hurry up," said
Bernie, "you're into me for fifteen
bucks."</p>

<p>"Get it back from Hank here," the
reporter said. He nodded at the newcomer,
"Want this hand? You're fourteen
points down. Lover boy's got
sixty-eight on game, but you're a box
up."</p>

<p>"Sure," said Tilton. He took the
cards.</p>

<p>The morning news reporters left.
The businessman dealt a new hand.
Tilton waited four rounds, then
knocked with ten.</p>

<p>Bernie slammed down his cards.
"You lousy reporters are all alike!
I'm going home." He got up to put
on his coat. "I'll be back about ten,
you still be here?"</p>

<p>"Sure," said Tilton, "... with the
score." He folded the paper and put
it in his pocket.</p>

<p>The businessman walked out and
Tilton went over to the deAngelis
board. "Anything?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Nah," said King. He pointed to
the lights, "Just lovers' quarrels tonight;
all pale pink and peaceful."</p>

<p>Tilton smiled and ambled back to
the cell block. The operator put his
feet up on his desk, then frowned
and put them down again. He leaned
toward the board and studied the
light at the end of the second row.
The needle registered sixty-six. The
operator pursed his lips, then flicked
a switch that opened the photo file.
Every five minutes an automatic
camera photographed the deAngelis
board, developed the film, and filed
the picture away in its storage vault.</p>

<p>King studied the photographs for
quite awhile, then pulled his log book
over and made an entry. He wrote:
8:20:19:3142:1x. The last three digits
meant that he wasn't sure about
the intensity, and the "x" signified a
continuous reading.</p>

<p>King turned to the audio controller,
"Do me a favor, Gus, but
strictly unofficial. Contact everybody
around us: Oakland, Squirrel Hill,
Point Breeze, Lawrenceville, Bloomfield
... everybody in this end of
town. Find out if they've got one
low intensity reading that's been on
for hours. If they haven't had it
since before midnight, I'm not interested."</p>

<p>"Something up?" the controller
asked.</p>

<p>"Probably not," said the operator.
"I'd just like to pin this one down as
close as I can. On a night like this
my screen shows nothing but milk."</p>

<hr />

<p>"Give you a lift home?" the older
reporter asked.</p>

<p>"Thanks," said the cub shaking his
head, "but I live out by the Youghiogheny
River."</p>

<p>"So?" the older man shrugged.
"Half hour flight. Hop in."</p>

<p>"I don't understand," the cub said.</p>

<p>"What? Me offering you a lift."</p>

<p>"No," said the cub. "Back there in
the station house. You know."</p>

<p>"You mean the deAngelis?"</p>

<p>"Not that exactly," said the cub.
"I understand a deAngelis board;
everybody broadcasts emotions, and
if they're strong enough they can be
received and interpreted. It's the
cops I don't understand. I thought
any reading over eighty was dangerous
and had to be looked into, and
anything over ninety was plain murder
and had to be picked up. Here
they been ignoring eighties and nineties
all night long."</p>

<p>"You remember that children's
story you wrote last Christmas about
an Irish imp named Sean O'Claus?"
his companion asked him.</p>

<p>"Certainly," the cub said scowling.
"I'll sell it some day."</p>

<p>"You remember the Fashion Editor
killed it because she thought
'See-Ann' was a girl's name, and it
might be sacrilegious."</p>

<p>"You're right I remember," the
cub said, his voice rising.</p>

<p>"Like to bet you didn't register
over ninety that day? As a matter of
fact, I'll head for the nearest precinct
and bet you five you're over
eighty right now." He laughed aloud
and the young man calmed down.
"I had that same idea myself at first.
About ninety being against the law.
That's one of the main troubles, the
law. Every damn state in the dominion
has its own ideas on what's dangerous.
The laws are all fouled up.
But what most of them boil down to is
this&mdash;a man has to have a continuous
reading of over ninety before he can
be arrested. Not arrested really, detained.
Just a reading on the board
doesn't prove a thing. Some people
walk around boiling at ninety all
their lives&mdash;like editors. But the
sweet old lady down the block, who's
never sworn in her life, she may hit
sixty-five and reach for a knife.
And that doesn't prove a thing. Ninety
sometimes means murder, but
usually not; up to a hundred and ten
usually means murder, but sometimes
not; and anything over one-twenty
always means murder. And it still
doesn't prove a thing. And then
again, a psychotic or a professional
gunsel may not register at all. They
kill for fun, or for business&mdash;they're
not angry at anybody."</p>

<p>"It's all up to the deAngelis operators.
They're the kingpins, they make
the system work. Not Simon deAngelis
who invented it, or the technicians
who install it, or the Police
Commissioner who takes the results
to City Hall. The operators make it
or break it. Sure, they have rules to
follow&mdash;if they want. But a good
operator ignores the rules, and a bad
operator goes by the book, and he's
still no damn good. It's just like radar
was sixty, seventy years ago.
Some got the knack, some don't."</p>

<p>"Then the deAngelis doesn't do
the job," said the cub.</p>

<p>"Certainly it does," the older man
said. "Nothing's perfect. It gives the
police the jump on a lot of crime.
Premeditated murder for one. The
average citizen can't kill anyone unless
he's mad enough, and if he's mad
enough, he registers on the deAngelis.
And ordinary robbers get caught;
their plans don't go just right, or
they fight among themselves. Or, if
they just don't like society&mdash;a good
deAngelis operator can tell quite a
bit if he gets a reading at the wrong
time of day or night, or in the wrong
part of town."</p>

<p>"But what about the sweet old
lady who registers sixty-five and then
goes berserk?"</p>

<p>"That's where your operator really
comes in. Usually that kind of a
reading comes too late. Grandma's
swinging the knife at the same time
the light goes on in the station
house. But if she waits to swing, or
builds herself up to it, then she may
be stopped.</p>

<p>"You know those poor operators
are supposed to log any reading over
sixty, and report downtown with
anything over eighty. Sure they are!
If they logged everything over sixty
they'd have writer's cramp the first
hour they were on watch. And believe
me, Sonny, any operator who
reported downtown on every reading
over eighty would be back
pounding a beat before the end of
his first day. They just do the best
they can, and you'd be surprised at
how good that can be."</p>

<hr />

<p>The old man woke up, but kept his
eyes closed. He was afraid. It was too
quiet, and the room was clammy
with an early morning chill. He
opened his eyelids a crack and
looked at the window. Still dark outside.
He lay there trembling and
brought his elbows in tight to his
body. He was going to have the
shakes; he knew he'd have the shakes
and it was still too early. Too early.
He looked at the clock. It was only a
quarter after five. Too early for the
bars to be open. He covered his eyes
with his hands and tried to think.</p>

<p>It was no use; he couldn't think.
He sobbed. He was afraid to move.
He knew he had to have a drink,
and he knew if he got up he'd be
sick. "Oh Lord!" he breathed.</p>

<p>The trembling became worse. He
tried to press it away by hugging his
body with his arms. It didn't help. He
looked wildly around and tried to
concentrate. He thought about the
bureau ... no. The dresser ...
no. His clothes ... he felt feverishly
about his body ... no. Under
the bed ... no ... wait ...
maybe. He'd brought some beer
home. Now he remembered. Maybe
there was some left.</p>

<p>He rolled over on his stomach and
groped under the bed. His tremulous
fingers found the paper bag and he
dragged it out. It was full of empty
cans; the carton inside was ripped.
He tore the sack open ... empty
cans ... no! there was a full one
... two full ones&mdash;</p>

<p>He staggered to his feet and
looked for an opener. There was one
on the bureau. He stumbled over and
opened his first beautiful, lovely can
of beer. He put his mouth down
close to the top so that none of the
foam could escape him. He'd be all
right 'til seven, now. The bars opened
at seven. He'd be all right 'til seven.</p>

<p>He did not notice the knife lying
beside the opener. He did not own a
knife and had no recollection of buying
one.</p>

<p>It was a hunting knife and he was
not a hunter.</p>

<hr />

<p>The light at the end of the second
row was growing gradually brighter.
The needle traveled slowly across the
dial, 68.2, 68.4, 68.6....</p>

<p>King called over to the audio controller.
"They all report in yet?"</p>

<p>The controller nodded. "Squirrel
Hill's got your signal on, same reading
as you have. Bloomfield thinks
they may have it. Oakland's not too
sure. Everybody else is negative."
The controller walked over. "Which
one is it?"</p>

<p>King pointed to the end of the
second row.</p>

<p>"Can't you get it on your screen?"</p>

<p>"Hell, yes, I've got him on my
screen!" King swiveled in his chair
and turned on the set. The scope was
covered with pale dots. "Which one
is he? There?" He pointed to the
left. "That's a guy who didn't get
the raise he wanted. There?" He
pointed to the center. "That's a little
girl with bad dreams. She has them
every night. There? That's my brother!
He's in the Veteran's Hospital and
wanted to come home a week ago."</p>

<p>"So don't get excited," said the
controller. "I only asked."</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, Gus," King apologized.
"My fault. I'm a little edgy ...
probably nothing at all."</p>

<p>"Well you got it narrowed down
anyway," Gus said. "If you got it,
and Squirrel Hill's got it, then he's
in Shadyside. If Oakland doesn't have
him, then he's on this side of Aiken
Avenue." The controller had caught
King's fever; the "it" had become a
"him". "And if Bloomfield doesn't
have him, then he's on the other side
of Baum Boulevard."</p>

<p>"Only Bloomfield might have him."</p>

<p>"Well what the hell, you've still got
him located in the lower half of
Shadyside. Tell you what, I'll send a
man up Ellsworth, get Bloomfield to
cruise Baum Boulevard in a scout
car, and have Squirrel Hill put a patrol
on Wilkens. We can triangulate."</p>

<p>"No," said King, "not yet. Thanks
anyway, Gus, but there's no point in
stirring up a tempest in a teapot. Just
tell them to watch it. If it climbs
over 75 we can narrow it down
then."</p>

<p>"It's your show," said Gus.</p>

<hr />

<p>The old man finished his second
can of beer. The trembling was almost
gone. He could stand and move
without breaking out in a cold sweat.
He ran his hand through his hair
and looked at the clock. 6:15. Too
early. He looked around the room
for something to read. There were
magazines and newspapers scattered
everywhere; the papers all folded
back to the sports section. He picked
up a paper, not even bothering about
the date, and tried to interest himself
in the batting averages of the
Intercontinental League. Yamamura
was on top with .387; the old man
remembered when Yamamura came
up as a rookie. But right now he
didn't care; the page trembled and
the type kept blurring. He threw the
paper down. He had a headache.</p>

<p>The old man got up and went
over to the bathroom. He steadied
himself against the door jamb and
kicked the wadded sweater out of
sight beneath the dresser. He went
into the bathroom and turned on the
water. He ran his hands over his
face and thought about shaving, but
he couldn't face the work involved.
He managed to run a comb through
his hair and rinse out his mouth.</p>

<p>He came back into the room. It
was 6:30. Maybe Freddie's was open.
If Freddie wasn't, then maybe the
Grill. He'd have to take his chances,
he couldn't stand it here any longer.
He put on his coat and stumbled out.</p>

<hr />

<p>At eight o'clock the watch was
changed; Matesic replaced King.</p>

<p>"Anything?" asked Matesic.</p>

<p>"Just this one, Chuck," said King.
"I may be a fool, but this one bothers
me." King was a diplomat where
Blaney was not.</p>

<p>King showed him the entry. The
dial now stood at 72.8. "It's been on
there all night, since before I had the
watch. And it's been climbing, just
slow and steady, but all the time
climbing. I locked a circuit on him,
but I'll take it off if you want me to."</p>

<p>"No," said Matesic, "leave it on.
That don't smell right to me neither."</p>

<hr />

<p>The old man was feeling better.
He'd been in the bar two hours, and
he'd had two pickled eggs, and the
bartender didn't bother him. Beer
was all right, but a man needed
whiskey when he was sick. He'd have
one, maybe two more, and then he'd
eat some breakfast. He didn't know
why, but he knew he mustn't get
drunk.</p>

<hr />

<p>At nine o'clock the needle on the
dial climbed past seventy-five. Matesic
asked for coverage. That meant
that two patrolmen would be tied up,
doing nothing but searching for an
echo. And it might be a wild goose
chase. He was explaining to the Captain,
but the Captain wasn't listening.
He was looking at the photographs
in the deAngelis file.</p>

<p>"You don't like this?" the Captain
asked.</p>

<p>Matesic said he didn't like it.</p>

<p>"And King said he didn't like it?"</p>

<p>"King thinks the same way I do,
he's been on there too damn long
and too damn consistent."</p>

<p>"Pick him up," the Captain turned
and ordered the audio controller. "If
we can't hold him, we can at least
get a look at him."</p>

<p>"It's not too clear yet," said Matesic,
"it'll take a spread."</p>

<p>"I know what it'll take," the Captain
roared. "Don't tell me my job!
Put every available man on this, I
want that guy brought in."</p>

<hr />

<p>The old man walked back to his
room. He was carrying a dozen cans
of beer, but the load was light and
he walked upright. He felt fine, like a
million dollars. And he was beginning
to remember.</p>

<p>When he entered the room he saw
the knife and when he saw the knife
he smiled. A man had to be smart
and a man had to be prepared. They
were smart ... wicked and smart
... but he was smarter. He'd
bought the knife a long, long time
ago, in a different world&mdash;they couldn't
fool him that way. They were
clever all right, they fooled the whole
world.</p>

<p>He put his beer on the bureau,
then walked into the bathroom and
turned on the water in the tub. He
came back out and started to undress.
He was humming to himself.
When he finished undressing he went
over to the bureau and opened a can
of beer. He carried it into the bathroom,
put it beside the tub, and
lowered himself into the water.</p>

<p>Ah ... that was the ticket. Water
and being clean. Clean and being
water. Being water and being candy
and being smart. They fooled the
whole world, but not him. The whole,
wide world, but they couldn't fool
him. He was going to fool them. All
pretty and innocent. Hah! Innocent!
He knew. They were rotten, they
were rotten all the way through.
They fooled the whole world but
they were rotten ... rotten ...
and he was the only one who knew.</p>

<p>He finished the beer and stood up
in the tub. The water ran off his
body in greasy runlets. He didn't
pull the plug. He stepped out of the
tub and over to the bathroom mirror.
His face looked fine, not puffy
at all. He'd fool them. He sprinkled
himself with lilac water, put the bottle
to his lips, and swished some of
it in his mouth. Oh yes, he'd fool
them. A man couldn't be too clever,
they were clever, so he had to be
clever. He began to shave.</p>

<hr />

<p>The Captain was on an audio circuit,
talking to an Assistant Commissioner.
"Yes, Sir, I know that&mdash;Yes,
Sir, it could be, but it might be
something else&mdash;Yes, Sir, I know
Squirrel Hill has problems, but we
need help&mdash;Yes, Commissioner, it's
over ninety now (The Captain signaled
wildly to Matesic; Matesic held
up four fingers, then two) 94.2 and
still going up&mdash;No, Sir, we don't
know. Some guy gonna quit his job
... or kill his boss. Maybe he found
out his wife is cheating on him. We
can't tell until we pick him up&mdash;Yes,
Sir&mdash;Yes, Sir&mdash;Thank you, Sir."</p>

<p>The Captain hung up. "I hate politicians,"
he snarled.</p>

<p>"Watch it, Captain," said Matesic,
"I'll get you on my board."</p>

<p>"Get me on it, Hell," the Captain
said, "I've never been off."</p>

<hr />

<p>The old man finished dressing. He
knotted his tie and brushed off the
front of his suit with his hand. He
looked fine. He'd fool them, he
looked just like anybody else. He
crossed to the bureau and picked up
the knife. It was still in the scabbard.
He didn't take it out, he just put
it in his pocket. Good. It didn't
show.</p>

<p>He walked out on the street. The
sun was shining brightly and heat
waves were coming up from the sidewalk.
Good. Good. This was the best
time. People, the real people, would
be working or lying down asleep.
But they'd be out. They were always
out. Out all sweet and innocent
in the hot sun.</p>

<p>He turned down the street and
ambled toward the drug store. He
didn't want to hurry. He had lots of
time. He had to get some candy
first. That was the ticket, candy.
Candy worked, candy always worked.
Candy was good but candy was
wicked. He was good but they were
wicked. Oh, you had to be smart.</p>

<hr />

<p>"That has to be him," Matesic
said. The screen was blotched and
milky, but a large splash of light in
the lower left hand corner outshone
everything else. "He's somewhere
around Negley Avenue." He turned
to the Captain. "Where do you have
your men placed?"</p>

<p>"In a box," the Captain said.
"Fifth and Negley, Aiken and Negley,
Center and Aiken, and Center
and Negley. And three scout cars
overhead."</p>

<hr />

<p>The old man walked up Ellsworth
to the Liberty School. There were always
lots of young ones around Liberty
School. The young ones were
the worst.</p>

<hr />

<p>"I'm losing him."</p>

<p>"Where are you?"</p>

<p>"Center and Aiken."</p>

<p>"Anybody getting him stronger?"</p>

<p>"Yeah. Me. Negley and Fifth."</p>

<p>"Never mind. Never mind, we got
him. We see him now."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"Bellefonte and Ivy. Liberty
School."</p>

<hr />

<p>She was a friendly little thing, and
pretty. Maybe five, maybe six, and
her Mommy had told her not to talk
to strangers. But the funny old man
wasn't talking, he was sitting on the
curb, and he was eating candy, and
he was offering some to her. He
smiled at the little girl and she smiled
back.</p>

<hr />

<p>The scout car settled to earth on
automatic. Two officers climbed out
of the car and walked quietly over to
the old man, one on either side. They
each took an arm and lifted him
gently to his feet.</p>

<p>"Hello there, Old Timer."</p>

<p>"Hi, little girl."</p>

<p>The old man looked around bewildered.
He dropped his candy and
tried to reach his knife. They mustn't
interfere. It was no use. The officers
were very kind and gentle, and they
were very, very firm. They led him
off as though he were an old, old
friend.</p>

<p>One of the officers called back
over his shoulder, "Bye, bye, little
girl."</p>

<p>The little girl dutifully waved
'bye.</p>

<p>She looked at the paper sack on
the sidewalk. She didn't know what
to do, but the nice old man was
gone. She looked around, but no
one was paying any attention, they
were all watching the softball game.
Suddenly she made a grab and
clutched the paper bag to her body.
Then she turned and ran back up
the street to tell her Mommy how
wonderful, wonderful lucky she
was. &#9632;</p>
